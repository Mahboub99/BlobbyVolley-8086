# BlobbyVolley

It's a game based on the existing game "Blobby Volley". The difference between the existing one and ours is that ours is made by Assembly language x86 specifically 8086 version. Another difference is that our game can be played in multiplayer mode using UART serial communication through the dos emulator “DosBox”.
